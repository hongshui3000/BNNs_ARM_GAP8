1. Setting up
---------------------------------------------------------

Before changing the network structure modify the
parameters in the following files:

tensor.h: 	Size and number of memory blocks
model.h: 	Maximum depth and maximum number of layers in the network
main.cpp: 	Network structure initialization and the and for the
        	weights of the convolutional filters
layers/BinConvolution.cpp:	Allocating memory for binarized weights, Batch Norm parameters and thresholds for Comparison
layers/FirstLayer.cpp:		Floating point weight and input, convolution, Batchn Normalization and finally Binarization
layers/BinCRBB.cpp:		Binary Convolution and Comparisons and generates binary output feature maps.
layers/LastLayer.cpp:		Last binary Convolution and followed by LastLayer Floating point convolution.

config.h:	By selecting #define, you can manipulate different configuration:

2. Usage
---------------------------------------------------------

make main
./main

3. Observations
---------------------------------------------------------

- The model file included reached a precision of 74%
- The test image included is test image number 2
- The network can not handle convolutions with feature maps
  that don't have a depth of 32
- Due to floating point precisions the final numerical result may vary
  by less than 1% (classification remains the same for all the images in
  the test set)
